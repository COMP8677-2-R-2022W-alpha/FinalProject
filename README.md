# Local DNS Attack

### Overview:
1. Use the labsetup to create the docker environment in your seed labs for local DNS attack with ```dcup```
2. We will execute one by one, task1.py, task2.py and then task3.py
3. Each task gives an extra edge to the attacker, making it more difficult to detect and easier to gather victim information by redirecting to the malicious website.

### Note:
1. If you are confused, you can follow the steps file contains all the steps to be followed sequentially to execute the attack after the lab setup has been done.
2. The presentation file contains the presentation given by the team "alpha".
